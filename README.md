## Description
this is an App that helps animals to be know and to get help from rangers,here by the rangers
 in the park are in charge of reporting any animal found in the park because there are some rare animals that
  are growing to be few so tha is why we need t help them to not die but survive.
## BDD

- We were asked to make an application where the user will be able to report an animal
 he/she saw in the park and the fill the form to communicate the animal he saw and also
  will be able to specify if the animal is endanger meaning the it is in the lst species or
   reducing and also report the normal animals.And all these will be achieved by filling the
    form,and for the ones in charge they will be able to help the animal depending on it's condition  
## Application setup
